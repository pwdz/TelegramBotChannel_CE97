## Intro
This is a **Telegram bot** that is used as an admin of a channel.  
When a user starts a chat with the bot, bot sends messages to a private channel that all the admins of channel are there.  
So admins can see messages without being in chat with user directly and can send answers to users. 
There is also a java **Logger** that saves messages to a file.
